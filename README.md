# **NeverSink's Enhanced Loot Filter - Clarity Edition**

## **ABOUT THIS FILTER**

This filter is a **customized version** of the original NeverSink PoE 2 loot filter, enhanced with larger font sizes, clearer highlights, and bold visual cues to help older players or those who struggle to see small item drops clearly. It is optimized for **Path of Exile 2 Early Access** and prioritizes clear, visible loot without hiding items unnecessarily.

This is **NOT** a hack or mod. The filter uses the official Path of Exile filter syntax and can be freely used.

2. **Regular Updates**: The filter will be updated before every major league start and periodically as needed. Check back monthly for updates.
